# Raspberry Pi
I have the binary setup and ready to go.

Before you run the miner, change the "mine.sh" script to reflect your
current pool, your username, & the number of threads you want to use.

# Pools I use
Because the RPI is not a particularly powerful board, most pools will
not work very well with this board, however I find that MinerGate works quite
well!

# Threads
I have all four threads churning away; however I do have the aluminum heat sink
on it, as well as a USB fan blowing to keep the unit cool.

If the unit gets too hot the hashrate will be diminished


# Expected Hashrate
I am getting somewhere around 9 h/s

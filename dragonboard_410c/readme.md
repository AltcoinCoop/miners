# DragonBoard 410 C
I have the binary setup and ready to go.

Before you run the miner, change the "mine.sh" script to reflect your
current pool, your username, & the number of threads you want to use.

# Pool I use
I am currently mining Electronium right now as it is more profitable to mine with a low powered device than Monero is (at the time of writing).

pool.etn.spacepools.org

For this pool you will need an Electronium wallet for the funds to be sent to.

# Expected Hashrate
* 4 Threads: ~13 H/S

If the unit gets too hot the hash rate will be diminished due to throttling
